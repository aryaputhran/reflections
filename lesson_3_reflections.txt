When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you use multiple computers for your work or multiple people work on same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

to have control on changes on the local repository and not break the code/project/branch.
